## 1. What is it ?
Packetman is a 2D platformer taking place in a computer. Its goal, other than entertainment, is to teach the concepts and structures behind networking and internet communication. It is entirely coded in Python using Pygame. It was originally started as a project for a computer course but is now more a personnal project to practice different programming skills.
